# Business problem



Rossmann's Chief Financial Officer will be implementing within the next weeks important remodeling across all units for the drugstore chain. 
To be able to complete such massive task, he decided to request from the Data Science team, a sales's projection for the next six weeks. With this information in hands, a responsible payment plan can be implemented with minimum financial risks to the stakeholders.  


# Strategy

The Data team decided to implement the CRISP model ( Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining ). A ciclic and flexible methodology with quick turnaround.
A brief description below.
